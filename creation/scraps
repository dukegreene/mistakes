Scraps

and it whispers "not enough"

I'm a machine learning machine learning machine learning

show me on the doll where that last line touched you

Take another breath
Think about the was
And I see all the way
And I read all the signs
And I open a bottle...

Light a cigarette
Eyes upon the clock
And I wonder aloud
And I wander the hall
And Iâ€™m under suspicion...

What if I was wrong?
What if I was right?
What if ----------------
